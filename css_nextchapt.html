    <h1>Beer</h1>
    <div>
        From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
        This article is about the alcoholic drink. For other uses, see Beer (disambiguation).
    </div>
    <p>
        Beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches from cereal grain—most
        commonly
        malted barley, although wheat, maize, rice, and oats are also used. The grain is mashed to convert starch in the
        grain to sugars, which dissolve in water to form wort. Fermentation of the wort by yeast produces ethanol and
        carbonation in the beer. Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and
        one
        of the most popular of all drinks. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours
        and
        act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent. Other flavouring agents, such as gruit, herbs, or fruits,
        may
        be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, natural carbonation is often replaced with forced
        carbonation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beer is distributed in bottles and cans, and is commonly available on draught in pubs and bars. The brewing
        industry
        is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller
        producers
        ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by
        volume (ABV).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the earliest writings mention the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi (1750 BC)
        included laws regulating it, while "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, contains
        a
        recipe for it. Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as
        beer
        festivals, as well as activities like pub games. Beer can cause health issues if consumed often or in excess;
        alcohol is an IARC group 1 carcinogen.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <div>
        <span>See also: Ale § Etymology</span>
    </div>
    <p>
        Old English: Beore 'beer'
        In early forms of English and in the Scandinavian languages, the usual word for beer was the word whose Modern
        English form is ale.[1] The modern word beer comes into present-day English from Old English bēor, itself from
        Common Germanic; it is found throughout the West Germanic and North Germanic dialects (modern Dutch and German
        bier,
        Old Norse bjórr). The earlier etymology of the word is debated: the three main theories are that the word
        originates
        in Proto-Germanic *beuzą (putatively from Proto-Indo-European *bʰeusóm), meaning "brewer's yeast, beer dregs";
        that
        it is related to the word barley; or that it was somehow borrowed from Latin bibere "to drink".[2][1]
    </p>
    <p>
        Christine Fell, in Leeds Studies in English (1975), suggests that the Old English/Norse word bēor did not
        originally
        denote ale or beer, but a strong, sweet drink rather like mead or cider. Whatever the case, the meaning of bēor
        expanded to cover the meaning of ale. When hopped ale from Europe was imported into Britain in the late Middle
        Ages,
        it was described as "beer" to differentiate it from the British unhopped ale, later acquiring a broader
        meaning.[1]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <div>
        <span class="tag">Main article: History of beer</span>
    </div>

    <h3>Prehistory</h3>
    <p>

        Ancient Egyptian painting, 18th dynasty, reign of Akhenaten, c. 1300 BC, showing Syrian mercenary drinking beer
        through a straw. Egyptian Museum of Berlin
        Beer is one of the world's oldest prepared alcoholic drinks.[3] The earliest archaeological evidence of
        fermentation
        consists of 13,000 year-old residues of a beer with the consistency of gruel, used by the semi-nomadic Natufians
        for
        ritual feasting, at the Raqefet Cave in the Carmel Mountains near Haifa in northern Israel.[4][5] There is
        evidence
        that beer was produced at Göbekli Tepe during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (around 8500 BC to 5500 BC).[6] The
        earliest
        clear chemical evidence of beer produced from barley dates to about 3500–3100 BC, from the site of Godin Tepe in
        the
        Zagros Mountains of western Iran.[7][8]
    </p>
    <h3>Early civilisations</h3>
    <p>
        Beer is recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt,[9][10] and archaeologists speculate that beer was
        instrumental in the formation of civilisations.[11] The Sumerians drank a variety of beers, eight types from
        barley,
        12 types from wheat and 3 from a mixture of grains.[12] The Sumerian goddess Ninkasi was believed to oversee the
        brewing process, and the production and distribution of beer was attributed there to women.[12] Approximately
        5000
        years ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers with volumes of beer.[13]
        During the building of the Egyptian pyramids, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer,
        which
        served as both nutrition and refreshment and was crucial to the pyramids' construction.[14]
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess
        Ninkasi,
        known as "The Hymn to Ninkasi",[15] which served as both a prayer and a method of remembering the recipe for
        beer in
        a culture with few literate people, and the ancient advice ("Fill your belly. Day and night make merry") to
        Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh by the alewife Siduri, may, at least in part, have referred to the
        consumption of beer.[16] The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the
        city in 2500 BC.[17] A fermented drink using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike sake, mould
        was
        not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by
        chewing or malting.[18][19][20] During the Vedic period in Ancient India, there are records of the consumption
        of
        the beer-like sura.[21][22] 4th century BCE Greek philosopher Xenophon noted that during his travels, "barley
        wine"
        was being produced in Armenia and drunk through straws.[23][24]
    </p>
    <h3>Medieval</h3>
    <p>
        François Jaques: Peasants enjoying beer at pub in Fribourg (Switzerland, 1923)
        Beer was spread through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes as far back as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on
        a
        domestic scale.[25][26] The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most
        people
        today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers may have contained fruits, honey, numerous
        types
        of plants, spices, and other substances such as narcotic herbs.[25] This mixture was called gruit, where if some
        were improperly heated could cause hallucinations. The mixture of gruit was different from every brewer. What
        they
        did not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian
        Abbot[27] and again in 1067 by abbess Hildegard of Bingen.[25]
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria adopted the Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality
        regulation still in use in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water,
        hops, and barley-malt.[28] Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution was made and sold on a domestic scale,
        although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the
        Industrial
        Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal to industrial manufacture, while domestic production
        ceased
        to be significant by the end of the 19th century.[29]
    </p>
    <h3>Modern</h3>
    <p>
        In 1912, brown bottles began to be used by the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the
        United
        States. This innovation has since been accepted worldwide as it prevents light rays from degrading the quality
        and
        stability of beer.[30] The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational
        companies and many thousands of smaller producers, ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.[31] As of 2006,
        more
        than 133 billion litres (35 billion US gallons) of beer are sold per year, producing global revenues of US$294.5
        billion. In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 billion litres (120 billion US gallons), or nearly twice that
        of
        the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and
        Germany.[32]
        Beer is the most widely consumed of all alcoholic drinks.[33] A widely publicised study in 2018 suggested that
        sudden decreases in barley production due to extreme drought and heat could in the future cause substantial
        volatility in the availability and price of beer.[34]

    <h2>Brewing</h2>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <div>
        <span class="tag">Main article: Brewing</span>
    </div>
    <p>
        A 16th-century brewery
        The process of making beer is brewing. It converts the grain into a sugary liquid called wort and then ferments
        this
        into beer using yeast. The first step, mixing malted barley with hot water in a mash tun, is "mashing".[35] The
        starches are converted to sugars, and the sweet wort is drained off. The grains are washed to extract as much
        fermentable liquid from the grains as possible.[36] The sweet wort is put into a kettle, or "copper",[37] and
        boiled. Hops are added as a source of bitterness, flavour, and aroma. The longer the hops are boiled, the more
        bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remain.[38] The wort is cooled and the yeast is
        added. The wort is then fermented, often for a week or longer. The yeast settles, leaving the beer clear.[39]
        During
        fermentation, most of the carbon dioxide is allowed to escape through a trap. The carbonation is often increased
        either by transferring the beer to a pressure vessel and introducing pressurised carbon dioxide or by
        transferring
        it before the fermentation is finished so that carbon dioxide pressure builds up inside the container.[40]
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, usually malted barley; a brewer's yeast to produce the
        fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops.[41] A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary
        carbohydrate source, such as maize (corn), rice, wheat, or sugar, often termed an adjunct, especially when used
        alongside malted barley.[42] Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum, and cassava root in
        Africa;
        potato in Brazil; and agave in Mexico.[43]
    </p>
    <p>
        Water is the main ingredient, accounting for 93% of beer's weight.[44] The level of dissolved bicarbonate
        influences
        beer's finished taste.[45] Due to the mineral properties of each region's water, specific areas were originally
        the
        sole producers of certain types of beer, each identifiable by regional characteristics.[46] Dublin's hard water
        is
        well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness, while the Plzeň Region's soft water is ideal for brewing Pilsner,
        such as Pilsner Urquell.[46] The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which benefits making pale ale to
        such
        a degree that brewers of pale ale add gypsum in a process known as Burtonisation.[47]
    </p>
    <p>
        The starch source provides the fermentable material and determines the strength and flavour of the beer. The
        most
        common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin
        germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting produces enzymes that convert
        starches into fermentable sugars.[48] Different roasting times and temperatures produce different colours of
        malt
        from the same grain. Darker malts produce darker beers.[49] Nearly all beers use barley malt for most of the
        starch,
        as its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which
        finally
        removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a
        filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other grains, including
        wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum may be used. Some brewers have produced
        gluten-free beer, made with sorghum, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley,
        and
        rye.[50]
    </p>
    <p>
        Hop cone in a Hallertau, Germany, hop yard
        Flavouring beer is the sole commercial use of hops.[51] The flower of the hop vine acts as a flavouring and
        preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. The flowers themselves are often called "hops". The first
        historical mention of the use of hops in beer dates from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalard of
        Corbie,[29][52] though widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer began in the thirteenth century.[29][52]
        Before then, beer was flavoured with other plants such as grains of paradise or 'alehoof'. Combinations of
        aromatic
        herbs, berries, and even wormwood were combined into aflavouring mixture known as gruit.[53] Some beers today,
        such
        as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company use plants other than hops for flavouring.[54] and Cervoise
        Lancelot
        by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company,[55]
    </p>
    <p>
        Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the
        International Bitterness Units scale. Hops further contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours.
        They
        have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms, and
        aids
        in "head retention",[56][57] the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity
        of
        hops is a preservative.[58][59]
    </p>
    <p>
        Yeast is the microorganism responsible for fermenting beer. It metabolises the sugars, producing ethanol and
        carbon
        dioxide, and thereby turns wort into beer. In addition, yeast influences the character and flavour.[60] The
        dominant
        types of beer yeast are top-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottom-fermenting Saccharomyces
        pastorianus.[61]
        Brettanomyces ferments lambics,[62] and Torulaspora delbrueckii ferments Bavarian weissbier.[63] Before the role
        of
        yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts. A few styles, such as
        lambics,
        rely on this method today, but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures.[64]
    </p>
    <p>
        Some brewers add clarifying agents or finings to beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out
        along
        with protein solids, and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer
        appear
        bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles such as wheat beers.[65]
        Clarifying
        agents include isinglass, from the swimbladders of fish; Irish moss, a seaweed; kappa carrageenan, from the
        seaweed
        Kappaphycus cottonii; Polyclar (artificial); and gelatin.[66] Beer marked "suitable for vegans" is clarified
        either
        with seaweed or with artificial agents.[67]

    <h3>Industry</h3>
    <p>
        In the 21st century, larger breweries have repeatedly absorbed smaller breweries. In 2002, South African
        Breweries
        bought the North American Miller Brewing Company to found SABMiller, becoming the second-largest brewery after
        North
        American Anheuser-Busch. In 2004, the Belgian Interbrew was the third-largest brewery by volume, and the
        Brazilian
        AmBev was the fifth-largest. They merged into InBev, becoming the largest brewery. In 2007, SABMiller surpassed
        InBev and Anheuser-Busch when it acquired Royal Grolsch, the brewer of Dutch brand Grolsch.[68] In 2008, when
        InBev
        (the second-largest) bought Anheuser-Busch (the third-largest), the new Anheuser-Busch InBev company became
        again
        the largest brewer in the world.[69] As of 2020, according to the market research firm Technavio, AB InBev was
        the
        largest brewing company in the world, with Heineken second, CR Snow third, Carlsberg fourth, and Molson Coors
        fifth.[70]

        Annual beer consumption per capita by country
        A microbrewery, or craft brewery, produces a limited amount of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can
        produce and still be classed as a 'microbrewery' varies by region and by authority; in the US, it is 15,000 US
        beer
        barrels (1.8 megalitres; 390 thousand imperial gallons; 460 thousand US gallons) a year.[71] A brewpub is a type
        of
        microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other drinking establishment. The highest density of breweries in the
        world,
        most of them microbreweries, exists in Franconia, Germany, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which
        has
        about 200 breweries.[72][73] The Benedictine Weihenstephan brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to
        the
        year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. It
        claims
        to be the oldest working brewery in the world.[74]

        Top-fermented beers
        Top-fermented beers are most commonly produced with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a top-fermenting yeast which
        clumps
        and rises to the surface,[75] typically between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F). At these temperatures, yeast
        produces
        significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result is often a beer
        with
        slightly "fruity" compounds resembling apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or prune, among others.[76] After
        the
        introduction of hops into England from Flanders in the 15th century, "ale" came to mean an unhopped fermented
        brew,
        while "beer" meant a brew with an infusion of hops.[77] The term 'real ale' was coined by the Campaign for Real
        Ale
        (CAMRA) in 1973 for "beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by secondary fermentation in the
        container
        from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide". It is applied to both
        bottle
        conditioned and cask conditioned beers.[78]
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the types of top-fermented beers, pale ale[79] predominantly uses pale malt. It is one of the world's
        major
        beer styles and includes India pale ale (IPA).[80] Mild ale has a predominantly malty palate. It is usually
        dark,
        with an abv of 3% to 3.6%.[81] Wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also
        contains
        a significant proportion of malted barley. Wheat beers are usually top-fermented.[82] Stout is a dark beer made
        using roasted barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. There are a number of variations
        including
        dry stout (such as Guinness), sweet stout, and Imperial (or Russian) stout.[80] Stout was originally the
        strongest
        variety of porter, a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of eighteenth century
        London.[83][80][84][85]
    </p>
    <h3>Bottom-fermented beers</h3>
    <p>
        Kriek, a lambic beer brewed with cherries
        Lager is cool-fermented beer. Pale lagers are the most commonly drunk beers in the world. Many are of the
        "pilsner"
        type. The name "lager" comes from the German "lagern" for "to store", as brewers in Bavaria stored beer in cool
        cellars during the warm summer months, allowing the beers to continue to ferment, and to clear any sediment.[86]
        Lager yeast is a cool bottom-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus). Lager typically undergoes primary
        fermentation at 7–12 °C (45–54 °F), and then a long secondary fermentation at 0–4 °C (32–39 °F) (the lagering
        phase). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions inhibit the natural
        production of esters and other byproducts, resulting in a "cleaner"-tasting beer.[87] With improved modern yeast
        strains, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically no more than 2 weeks. Some
        traditional lagers are still stored for several months.[88]
    </p>
    <h3>Lambic</h3>
    <p>
        Lambic, a beer of Belgium, is naturally fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many of these are
        not
        strains of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness.
        Yeast varieties such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics. In
        addition,
        other organisms such as Lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.[89]

    <p>
        Around the world, many traditional and ancient starch-based drinks are classed as beer. In Africa, there are
        ethnic beers made from sorghum or millet, such as Oshikundu[90] in Namibia and Tella in Ethiopia.[91]
        Kyrgyzstan also has a beer made from millet; it is a low alcohol, somewhat porridge-like drink called "Bozo"
        .[92] Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet and Sikkim also use millet in Chhaang, a popular semi-fermented rice/millet drink
        in the eastern Himalayas.[93]
    </p>
    <p>
        The Andes in South America has Chicha, made from germinated maize (corn); while the indigenous peoples
        in Brazil
        have Cauim, a traditional drink made since pre-Columbian times by chewing manioc so that an enzyme
        (amylase) present
        in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars;[94] this is similar to Masato in
        Peru.[95]

        Beers made from bread, among the earliest forms of the drink, are Sahti in Finland, Kvass in Russia and
        Ukraine, and
        Bouza in Sudan. 4000 years ago fermented bread was used in Mesopotamia. Food waste activists got
        inspired by these
        ancient recipes and use leftover bread to replace a third of the malted barley that would otherwise be
        used for
        brewing their craft ale.[96]
